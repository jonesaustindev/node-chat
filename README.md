# Full stack chat app

### Summary

The frontend uses React with TypeScript, Tailwind, and Vite. The chat app is designed to give off old terminal vibes. The backend uses NodeJS with TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL. Users are created and verified via a JWT token. The chat is powered by websockets. I wanted to create this with minimal dependencies so I didn't use a websocket wrapper or ORM for interacting with the database. Just for a fun exercise without those things I tend to reach for.

## Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

## Backend: NodeJS + TypeScript + PostgreSQL
